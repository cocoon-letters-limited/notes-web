    question: "What is the main purpose of the Maintenance Management module?",
    answer: `The Maintenance Management module helps organizations manage their 
    maintenance operations by providing tools for work order management, 
    preventive maintenance scheduling, asset tracking, and more`,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Can I schedule preventive maintenance tasks in advance?",
    answer: `Yes, the Preventive Maintenance Scheduler feature allows you to schedule and
    automate preventive maintenance tasks in advance to ensure optimal 
    performance and reduce equipment downtime.`,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Can I create custom maintenance workflows?",
    answer: `Yes, the software allows you to create custom maintenance workflows tailored
    to your organization's specific needs, such as multi-step approvals, equipment 
    inspection processes, and more.`,
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question:
      "How do I get started with predictive maintenance using this EAM software?",
    answer: `To get started with predictive maintenance, you'll need to set up sensors and 
    other monitoring devices on your equipment. Once the data is flowing into the 
    EAM software, you can configure the system to analyze it and generate alerts 
    when certain conditions are met.`,
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question:
      "How do I implement predictive maintenance across my organization?",
    answer: `Successful implementation of predictive maintenance requires commitment 
    from everyone in the organization, from leadership to front-line workers. Start by
    clearly defining goals and expectations, then establish a plan for training 
    employees and rolling out the technology. Finally, monitor progress and adjust 
    the implementation as needed.`,
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question:
      "How can I optimize predictive maintenance using this EAM software?",
    answer: `Continuously monitor the performance of your predictive maintenance 
    program using data analytics to identify areas of improvement. Regularly review 
    the data and update your predictive models to improve accuracy. Additionally, 
    be sure to integrate feedback from technicians and adjust your maintenance 
    practices accordingly.`,
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question:
      "What kind of data is needed to implement predictive maintenance?",
    answer: `To implement predictive maintenance, you need a variety of data, including 
    sensor data, maintenance records, and equipment history. This data is used to 
    build predictive models that can anticipate equipment failures and optimize 
    maintenance schedules.`,
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "How does predictive maintenance help improve safety?",
    answer: `By identifying and predicting equipment failures before they occur, predictive 
    maintenance can help prevent equipment malfunctions that could lead to safety 
    incidents. Additionally, by optimizing maintenance schedules, predictive 
    maintenance can help reduce the risk of equipment failure during operation.`,
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question:
      "How does the software handle work orders and maintenance requests?",
    answer: `The software provides tools for creating and managing work orders and 
    maintenance requests, allowing you to track progress, assign tasks, and manage
    costs associated with maintenance activities.`,
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "Can I track asset information and maintenance history?",
    answer: `Yes, the software allows you to track asset information, including equipment 
    specifications and maintenance history, to ensure optimal performance and 
    reduce downtime.`,
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    question: "Can I set up automated maintenance alerts?",
    answer: `Yes, the software provides automated maintenance alerts to help you stay on 
    top of equipment maintenance schedules and reduce the risk of unexpected 
    downtime.`,
